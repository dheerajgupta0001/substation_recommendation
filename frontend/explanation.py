# scada->rutvija code-> output->input to our code-> database-> frontend.

# rutvijas code runs every 5 mins 
# hence we get our input every 5 mins

# for example:
# 1st iteration at t=0;
# we display the results on frontend
# 2nd iteration at t=5;
# we delete the previous results and display the new results on frontend
